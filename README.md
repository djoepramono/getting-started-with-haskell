# Getting Started with Haskell

This repository contains code examples used in my article on [Medium]()

# Setup

- Install `stack`. Installation instruction can be found [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)
- Run `stack ghci` in the root folder
- Once inside, you can load other file by typing `:load` e.g. `:load src/Activity.hs`
